# Implementation and Analysis of a Simple Perceptron

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple perceptron to solve logical functions (e.g., AND) and perform linear regression tasks (e.g., fitting `y = 2x + 1`). The work evaluates the perceptron's performance by analyzing the impact of initial weights, learning rates, and target value variations.

## Overview

The perceptron, inspired by Frank Rosenblatt's 1958 foundational work, is a simple machine learning model used for binary classification and regression tasks. This project explores its ability to adapt to different datasets and parameter configurations.

## Objectives

1. **Logical Classification**:
   - Solve the logical AND function using a perceptron with two inputs and a bias node.
2. **Linear Regression**:
   - Train the perceptron to fit the equation `y = 2x + 1`.
3. **Parameter Analysis**:
   - Evaluate the effects of:
     - Initial weights.
     - Learning rates.
     - Adding more target values.
